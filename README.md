# Repo to accompany Paper

"Predicting trends in the quality of state-of-the-art neural networks without access to training or testing data"

## Requirements to reproduce results: 

 Python 3.7.6
 weightwatcher 0.2.7 (only this version)

 Conda environment in requirements.txt

## Includes

 Jupyter Notebooks for reproducing most Tables and all Figures

 All results can be generated using pretrained models available in the [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html) pyTorch models
 (except ResNet-1K, which requies the Cv Sandbox)

### data

 Contains data from weightwatcher runs using Google Colab
 All Tables and Figures are generated directly from this raw data

### distiller/

 Jupyter Notebooks for reproducing Figure 4 and accompanying text
 (note: user must install Intell [distiller](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/distiller) to run these)

### submission

 original Latex files

### img/

 images, generated by Jupyter Notebooks
 
 ### pdfs/
 
 current PDF of the archive paper

#### Deprecated: ww-colab/


 Data from older submission:
 Google Colab Notebooks for reproducing results in sections 6

 Notebooks can be run in parallel on the users Google Cloub
 They Will download pretrained models from the [CV Sandbox](https://github.com/osmr/imgclsmob)
